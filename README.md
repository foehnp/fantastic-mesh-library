# fantastic-mesh-library

FML is a templated header library with a triangular mesh class (with half-edge structure), some import/export functionality (so far for simple .obj mesh files) and some algorithms (so far an octree and nearest point search on top of it).

To use it you need Eigen (I used version 3.4.0) to change the "INCLUDEPATH" for Eigen.
